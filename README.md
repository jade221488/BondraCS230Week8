#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted me to design a web-based version of their mobile game, Draw It or Lose it. The software requirements from the client were that one or more teams are involved, multiple players are in each team, game and team names are unique to each other, the singleton pattern is used so only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time, and the gaming application is accessible to mobile and web-based platforms. 


#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did well in developing the layout needed to understand what the client's needs are and what the next steps are to develop it. I also felt I did well in explaining what the development requirements are for the server and client side of different operating platforms. 


#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I felt  the domain model in the design document helped me be able to develop the code. The given UML diagram helped guide me on how each class are in relation to each other. The diagram also clearly displayed what variables and functions are required in each class. Then, explaining each component of the diagram helped me thorougly understand what is expected of me when it came to developing the code.


#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part that I would work on revising in this documentation is the recommendations. To improve it, I would do more research to make sure I am recommending options that would best suit the application.


#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs and implemented them into my software design by considering the goals of the game given by the client and how my software design impacts the usability and performance of the application. By having a successful software design, the application will meet the demands of the user. For example, multiple teams consisting of multiple players are on at once while the application maintains performance and speed simultaneously. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing as they are the most important audience to critize the application. If the usability of the application is not good then there would be no user base. 


#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software using Agile practices. Going through the phases of the software development life cycle helped me develop code with ease as I had a plan, designed it, tested it, and if needed repeated the process until the application worked to standard. A strategy I would use in the future is planning more ahead of time such as drawing out my plan as I am more of a visual learner and find anything drawn out for me is easiest to understand.
